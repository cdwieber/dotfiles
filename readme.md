# Dotfiles

A collection of my personal dotfiles. The `main` branch was configured on Ubuntu 22.04 running i3 and i3blocks as a desktop environment.

There's also a `macos` branch which has some specific adjustments that were made for my work machine.

The config files can be automatically symlinked by cloning the repo and then running `./install` in the appropriate branch; however, as always you should inspect the install script and config files and make any necessary adjustments for your specific environment beforehand.
